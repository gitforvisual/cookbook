###Tortilla soup

- Some canola and/or olive oil
- 1 pound chicken breast tenders, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 large (28oz) can stewed tomatoes, undrained. 
- 1 box of Trader Joe's chicken broth - 24-28oz-ish
- 2 teaspoons fresh minced or crushed garlic
- 1 tsp Tony Chachere's "More Spice" seasoning 
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- A smallish chunk of adobo chili pepper (get them in a can with the sauce)
- A handful of shredded cheddar cheese.
- 1 bag of tortilla strips
- 1 lime, cut into wedges

####Instructions

Dump about 1 tsp or so of canola oil in a pan and sauté the garlic and chicken for a couple of minutes until the chicken is all white but not browning. I add a little olive oil too just because I like olive oil. 

Dump all of that in to a stew pot. Add almost all of the broth box, the cumin and Tony Chachere's, stir that around, and add about 3/4 of the tomatoes and accompanying juice. I like to cut the tomatoes into smaller pieces, halves or quarters.

Finely chop a quarter-sized piece of the adobo chili and add it to the broth. Chop it fine so it dissolves into the broth. A little goes a long way and you can always add more.

Bring this to a boil and reduce heat to simmer, cover for for 30-45 minutes or until the chicken and tomatoes start to break up.

Throw in a handful of cheese and the chopped cilantro. Now it's time to asses your mix. Is it thick enough? Could it use a little more broth? how about more tomatoes? Is it smoky tasting and spicy enough? Add a tiny bit more of the adobo if it's not. More cheese if it's too thin. Careful with the cheese.

Serve with the tortilla strips and squeeze the lime over it. Enjoy!

###Roasted Garlic Spread

This, along with brie and a nice bottle of red, is my de facto go-to party dish. It fairly cheap and easy, and it’s always a hit. Prep time: 10 minutes. Cook time: An hour to an hour and 15 minutes.

Garlic bulbs (one or two per person)
Olive Oil
Ground pepper
Sea Salt
Aluminum Foil
A baking tray or pie dish

####Instructions

Pre-heat your oven to 375. Take each clove and remove any really flaky skin. Cut off the top of the bulb so that most of the tops of the cloves are exposed. I find that a bread knife works really well for this. 

Take a square of aluminum foil, place a bulb in the center, and wrap the foil up around the sides, but don’t fully close it. You will need to get oil, salt, and pepper in there still. So, do that next. Drizzle olive oil on the top of the bulb - use your best guess as to how much but I usually use about a teaspoon. The oil will flavor the garlic, but it also helps it to cook. So if you don’t put enough on, you may be disappointed.

Grind a little salt and pepper on the tops, and then finish sealing the foil by crunching it all together over the top. It’s important to seal it up so the garlic stays moist. Also, I’ve tried putting multiple bulbs in one piece of foil and the garlic didn’t cook.

Put them in the center of the oven and bake for an hour. Pull out a bulb with an oven mitt and give it a light squeeze. It should be mushy. If it’s not, put it back in for 10 or 15 minutes.

When it’s finished cooking, pull it out of the oven to cool for a while. Into a bowl, squeeze the bulb so that all of the baked garlic oozes out. It should have the consistency of peanut butter. Squeeze out as much garlic as you can and then whip it with a fork. Done! Delicious with brie on crackers or by itself on toasted and buttered baguette slices.
