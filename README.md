### Tortilla soup.

- Some canola and/or olive oil
- 1 pound chicken breast tenders, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 large (28oz) can stewed tomatoes, undrained.
- 1 box of Trader Joe's chicken broth - 24-28oz-ish
- 2 teaspoons fresh minced or crushed garlic
- 1 tsp Tony Chachere's "More Spice" seasoning
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- A smallish chunk of adobo chili pepper (get them in a can with the sauce)
- A handful of shredded cheddar cheese.
- 1 bag of tortilla strips
- 1 lime, cut into wedges

#### Instructions

Dump about 1 tsp or so of canola oil in a pan and saut√© the garlic and chicken for a couple of minutes until the chicken is all white but not browning. I add a little olive oil too just because I like olive oil.

Dump all of that in to a stew pot. Add almost all of the broth box, the cumin and Tony Chachere's, stir that around, and add about 3/4 of the tomatoes and accompanying juice. I like to cut the tomatoes into smaller pieces, halves or quarters.

Finely chop a quarter-sized piece of the adobo chili and add it to the broth. Chop it fine so it dissolves into the broth. A little goes a long way and you can always add more.

Bring this to a boil and reduce heat to simmer, cover for for 30-45 minutes or until the chicken and tomatoes start to break up.

Throw in a handful of cheese and the chopped cilantro. Now it's time to asses your mix. Is it thick enough? Could it use a little more broth? how about more tomatoes? Is it smoky tasting and spicy enough? Add a tiny bit more of the adobo if it's not. More cheese if it's too thin. Careful with the cheese.

Serve with the tortilla strips and squeeze the lime over it. Enjoy!
